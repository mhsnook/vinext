        This is a demo e-commerce site with 500 product pages, built to
        demonstrate Traffic-aware Pre-Warming (TPR). Each product page
        uses ISR with a 1-hour revalidation window.
      </p>
      <p className="product-desc">
        When deployed with <code>npx @vinext/cloudflare deploy --traffic-aware-warm-cache</code>, TPR
        queries Cloudflare zone analytics to determine which product pages
        actually get traffic, then sends only those routes through vinext's
        standard CDN pre-warmer. The rest are rendered and cached on demand.
